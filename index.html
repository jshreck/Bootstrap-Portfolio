                <hr>
                <img class="me" src="./assets/images/me.jpg" alt="Me with my dog, Winston">
                <p>Hello! My name is Julia (as I'm guessing you've probably already deduced). You may also be able to guess that I love animals. Pictured is my dog, Winston, who is no longer a puppy, but is still super cute. 
                </p>
                <p>A little more about me: I'm from Weyers Cave, VA, a small town you probably haven't heard of near Harrisonburg, VA. I graduated from UVA with a double major in biology and psychology. Since graduation, I've worked in a couple of different labs and gotten the opportunity to work on a variety of projects (producing DNA, pharmaceutical testing, cancer screening). However, I also realized that working in a lab isn't what I really want to do. I've always been interested in computer programming and even took an intro class in college. Working in the lab, I found myself wanting to know more about the software-side processes behind what I was doing, and coming up with all these ideas to improve these processes, but lacking the skills to do so myself. After a lot of debate, I decided I needed to switch careers. Then, there was the big question of "ok, so what do I do now?" 
                </p>
                <p>After a lot of research and thought, I decided to enroll in the coding boot camp through the University of Richmond. So now I'm in the "this is what" phase! I'm a little nervous, but mostly excited, to see how it goes. Some of the technologies I will learn include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML5, CSS</li>
                        <li> Javascript and jquery</li>
                        <li>Java and Bootstrap</li>
                        <li>Express.js, React.js, and Node.js</li>
                        <li>Database Theory</li>
                        <li>Bookshelf.js</li>
                        <li>MongoDB, mySQL</li>
                        <li>Command Line</li>
                        <li>Git</li>
                    </ul>
                And in July I'll graduate as full stack developer!
